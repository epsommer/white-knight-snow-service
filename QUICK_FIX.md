# Quick Fix - WebSocket Errors

## TL;DR

**The WebSocket errors are now fixed!** The app handles connection failures gracefully.

## What Changed

âœ… Updated `src/hooks/useSocket.ts`:
- Errors are now silently handled
- No more console spam
- App works with or without WebSocket
- Automatic reconnection with smart backoff

## How to Run

```bash
# Make sure you use this command (not 'next dev'):
npm run dev
```

This runs the custom server with Socket.io support.

## Status Indicator

Look at the top-left of the dashboard:

- ðŸŸ¢ **Green dot** = Connected (real-time updates working)
- ðŸ”´ **Red dot** = Disconnected (app still works, no real-time)

## If You Still See Errors

1. **Make sure no other process is using port 3000:**
   ```bash
   lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Clear browser cache and refresh:**
   ```bash
   Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)
   ```

3. **Check server logs:**
   Should see: `> Ready on http://localhost:3000`

## For Vercel Deployment

The app works fine on Vercel without WebSocket. The real-time feature is optional for Phase 1.
