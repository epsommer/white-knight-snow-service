# WebSocket Connection Errors - Troubleshooting Guide

## Problem

You're seeing WebSocket errors in the browser console:

```
websocket error
WS.onError
./node_modules/engine.io-client/build/esm/transport.js
```

## Root Cause

The Socket.io client is trying to connect, but the WebSocket server isn't responding. This happens when:

1. You're running `next dev` directly instead of the custom server
2. The custom server (`server.js`) isn't running
3. Port 3000 is blocked or already in use

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Use the Custom Server (RECOMMENDED)

Make sure you're running the app with the custom server that includes Socket.io:

```bash
# ✅ CORRECT - Run with custom server
npm run dev

# ❌ WRONG - Don't run Next.js directly
npx next dev
```

The `npm run dev` command runs `node server.js`, which includes both Next.js AND the Socket.io server.

### Solution 2: Verify the Server is Running

Check if the server started correctly:

```bash
# Start the server
npm run dev

# You should see:
# > Ready on http://localhost:3000
# Client connected: [socket-id]  (when you open the browser)
```

If you don't see "Ready on http://localhost:3000", check for errors in the startup logs.

### Solution 3: Clear Port 3000

If port 3000 is already in use:

```bash
# macOS/Linux
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9

# Windows
netstat -ano | findstr :3000
taskkill /PID <PID> /F

# Then restart
npm run dev
```

### Solution 4: The App Now Gracefully Handles Missing WebSocket

**Good news**: I've updated the code to handle WebSocket connection failures gracefully. The app will work fine even if WebSocket isn't available.

**Changes made to `src/hooks/useSocket.ts`:**

1. ✅ Errors are silently handled (no console spam)
2. ✅ Connection state updates correctly (shows red dot when disconnected)
3. ✅ Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
4. ✅ Polling fallback if WebSocket fails
5. ✅ Development-only logging

**What you'll see:**

- 🟢 **Green dot** = WebSocket connected
- 🔴 **Red dot** = WebSocket disconnected (app still works!)

The dashboard will still function normally, loading data from the API. Real-time updates just won't work until WebSocket connects.

## Testing the Fix

### 1. Test with Server Running

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start the server
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Open browser
open http://localhost:3000/dashboard

# You should see:
# - Green connection indicator
# - No console errors
```

### 2. Test without Server (Graceful Degradation)

```bash
# Don't start the server at all
# Just open the built files or use next dev

# You should see:
# - Red connection indicator
# - No console errors (silently handled)
# - App still works (loads mock data)
```

## Understanding the Connection Flow

```
Browser → Socket.io Client → Attempts Connection
                ↓
        Is server running?
                ↓
        YES ✅              NO ❌
        Connect           Fail silently
        Green dot         Red dot
        Real-time ✅      Polling only
```

## WebSocket Configuration

Located in `src/hooks/useSocket.ts`:

```typescript
const socketInstance = io(socketUrl, {
  transports: ['polling', 'websocket'], // Try polling first
  reconnection: true,                   // Auto-reconnect
  reconnectionAttempts: 5,              // Try 5 times
  reconnectionDelay: 1000,              // Wait 1s between attempts
  timeout: 10000,                       // 10s timeout
});
```

## When to Use WebSocket vs REST API

| Feature | WebSocket | REST API |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| Initial page load | ❌ | ✅ (fetch) |
| Real-time updates | ✅ | ❌ |
| Driver positions | ✅ | Polling |
| Property CRUD | ❌ | ✅ |

**The app uses BOTH:** REST API for data fetching, WebSocket for real-time updates.

## Verifying WebSocket is Working

### Browser DevTools

1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to **Network** tab
3. Filter by **WS** (WebSocket)
4. Look for connection to `localhost:3000`
5. Should show **101 Switching Protocols** if successful

### Server Logs

When working correctly, you'll see:

```
> Ready on http://localhost:3000
Client connected: abc123xyz
Socket abc123xyz joined room: dashboard
```

## Production Deployment

For production (Vercel, etc.), you'll need a separate WebSocket server:

1. **Option A**: Use Vercel Serverless Functions + Pusher/Ably
2. **Option B**: Deploy WebSocket server separately (Railway, Render)
3. **Option C**: Disable WebSocket, use polling only

For Phase 1, the app works fine without WebSocket - it's an enhancement.

## Disabling WebSocket Entirely (Optional)

If you want to completely disable WebSocket for now:

1. Comment out the socket hook in `src/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx`:

```typescript
// const { socket, isConnected } = useSocket();
const socket = null;
const isConnected = false;
```

2. The rest of the app will work normally with API polling.

## Summary

✅ **Fixed**: WebSocket errors no longer spam console
✅ **Fixed**: App works with or without WebSocket
✅ **Fixed**: Graceful reconnection handling
✅ **Fixed**: Clear connection status indicator

The app is now resilient to WebSocket failures and will work perfectly even if the custom server isn't running!

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Start with WebSocket server
npm run dev

# Kill any process on port 3000
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9

# Check what's running on port 3000
lsof -i:3000

# Test the API without WebSocket
curl http://localhost:3000/api/properties
```

**Status**: ✅ WebSocket errors are now handled gracefully. The app works with or without WebSocket connectivity.
